This is GapAlign - my final project for a Computational Biology project at Reed College.
GapAlign will take two provided DNA sequences and determine how best to match them together, 
allowing for random mutation, insertions, deletions, and other distortions that occur in a genome
over time.

This function can determine how closely related two species are, or attempt to locate specific patterns
in a larger genome. 

Manipulate how the program weights various issues with the gapStart, gapContinue, match, and mismatch
variables. Put the DNA to be matched in s1 and s2.
